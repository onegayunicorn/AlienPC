# AlienPC Ω (Omega)

## Introduction

The **AlienPC Ω** repository serves as the foundational blueprint for an advanced ecosystem dedicated to planetary healing, AI-guided genomics, and decentralized council governance. This project integrates cutting-edge gene-editing simulations with robust security protocols to address complex biological challenges, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several specialized directories to ensure a clear separation of concerns and a modular architecture:

| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `bin/` | Contains executable scripts and core AI processes designed for Termux and Linux environments. |
| `council/` | Houses governance protocols, decision logs, and quorum simulation tools. |
| `genomics/` | Dedicated to planetary healing research, including patient profiles and treatment simulations. |
| `docs/` | Comprehensive documentation covering branch strategies, security keys, and the project codex. |
| `.github/` | Automated workflows for continuous integration and security enforcement. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To effectively utilize this repository, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- **Python 3.11+** for running simulations and core processes.
- **Git** for version control and repository management.
- **GPG** for signing commits to comply with the project's security standards.

### Quick Start

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[username]/AlienPc.git
    cd AlienPc
    ```
2.  **Initialize the Environment**:
    Run the setup script (if available) or install necessary dependencies.
3.  **Run a Simulation**:
    ```bash
    python3 council/simulations/kaleidoscope/council_dashboard.py --check-only
    ```

## Security and Governance

Security is a paramount concern for AlienPC Ω. All contributions must be **GPG-signed** to be accepted. The **Omega Council** oversees the validation of all protocols and proposals to ensure ethical and technical integrity.

For more detailed information, please refer to the documentation in the `docs/` folder.
